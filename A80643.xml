         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>WE have no envy nor malice to any Creature, Prieſt or Peple, but are to minde you of your conditions, without any partiality or hypocriſie, and wiſh your eternal good: and what we contend againſt is your greateſt enemy, and will be your everlaſting woe and torment, if it be not deſtroy'd in you. For know, there is the ſeed of the Woman, and the ſeed of the Serpent in the World, there is the generation of <hi>Cain</hi> and righteous <hi>Abel.</hi> Now it lieth upon you all to know what ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration you are of: for little did the falſe Prophets and that generation that put to death the true Prophets of the Lord, think they were of <hi>Cain</hi>'s race; nor did the Scribes and Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees, that with their Prieſts put Chriſt to death, think they were of <hi>Cain</hi>'s generation, for they garniſhed the Sepulchres of the righteous, and ſaid, <hi>If they had been in the dayes of their fathers, they w uld not have ſlain them;</hi> yet Chriſt Jeſus told them, <hi>That all the blood ſpilt ſince righteous Abel, ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of that generation;</hi> and, <hi>that they were the children of them that murthered the Prophets.</hi> Is it not ſtrange, that the learned Prieſts and Scribes, and <hi>Pilate</hi> that had the Hebrew and Greek beſides Latine, ſhould not finde out by all their high learning, the original of the Scriptures of the Prophets, concerning Chriſt Jeſus, that he was the true M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſſiah: but that they that read the Goſpel every Sabbath day, that ſpake of Chriſt, ſhould murder and put him to death. Now Chriſt Jeſus himſelf gives the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:168327:2"/>and thanks his Father, that he had hid it from the wiſe, and prudent, and revealed it to babes, becauſe it was the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's good pleaſure, and the Scriptures declare them to be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, that had the Hebrew, Greek and Latine, <hi>For had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of life and glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now People, this was the ſame generation of <hi>Cain</hi> in them after Chriſts death, that perſecuted the Apoſtles and put them to death; and it was the ſame ſpirit in them that put the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs to death, and of that generation were the Biſhops that perſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uted, and ſo it continueth ſtill to this day in the World; for <hi>Cain</hi>'s generation is now ſtill envying, hating, and perſecut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the righteous <hi>Abel.</hi> Now the perſecuting Cainiſh gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration would never acknowledge they were ſuch, but in all ages perſecuted the juſt under ſome falſe colour, as they of old ſaid, <hi>The true Prophets were troublers of Iſrael;</hi> and <hi>Amaziel</hi> the Prieſt of <hi>Bethel</hi> ſaid of <hi>Amos, That the Land was not able to bear his words;</hi> and <hi>Haman</hi> ſaid, <hi>that the Laws of the people of God were contrary to the Laws and Customes of all Nations;</hi> &amp; of <hi>Chriſt</hi> they ſaid, <hi>He was a Deceiver<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and had a Devil;</hi> and of <hi>Stephen,</hi> That <hi>he ſpake againſt the holy Place and the Law;</hi> and, That <hi>Paul was a pestilent fellow, and a mover of ſedition:</hi> ſo that all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long it was on a falſe account, the juſt were perſecuted: ſo in the dayes of the Biſhops, the Martyrs were burnt and but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chered under the name of Hereticks; ſo now the ſeed of the Serpent is ſubtil, and will not perſecute the Truth, as it is the Truth, but under ſome falſe pretence or other, elſe all would ſee their deceit. But the Truth is, it's from the firſt riſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their own works are evil, and their brothers good: they hated Chriſt Jeſus, becauſe he teſtified that their works were evil. So now <hi>Cains</hi> generation hates the juſt and pure ſeed of God, becauſe it declares that their works are evil.</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>But do not the Prieſts declare againſt evil works?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yes, they do ſo: the Scribes and Phariſees ſpake good words, they ſpake of the Meſſiah, yet they killed the ſubſtance of what they ſpake: ſo the Prieſts ſpeak true words, good words, and yet kill, and perſecute, purſue, and impriſon the ſubſtance and life of what they ſpeak, for he that departs from evil makes himſelf a prey to Prieſt and People; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times when the light in their conſciences, tells them, when
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:168327:2"/>they are perſecuting the juſt ſeed, <hi>That they are innocent,</hi> yet they wilfully run on againſt the very light of their own conſciences, as did <hi>Stephens</hi> perſecutors.</p>
            <p>And is it not ſo? I ſpeak to that in your conſciences, That though the Prieſts ſpeak true words, yet Prieſts and people that live in <hi>Cains</hi> race, do purſue and perſecute even to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry death, the life and power of what they do preach. And know you of a truth, that all the blood ſince <hi>Abel,</hi> ſhall be required of this generation; for, as it groweth to the end, it height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth and ripeneth its malice and wickedneſs, and ſo ſhall its judgement be, for double plagues ſhall be poured out upon her.</p>
            <p>Now to you all I ſpeak, ſin not againſt the light in your own conſciences, be not wilfully blinde, but hearken to the light of Jeſus Chriſt in your Conſciences, that you may come to ſee what generation you are of, whether of <hi>Cain</hi> or <hi>Abel:</hi> and if you did abide in the light, you ſhould come to witneſs the life and power of what you profeſs, and ſo come to that life that gave forth the Scriptures, and not wreſt them to your own Opinions and luſts: One ſaying, Loe here in Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; another, Loe there in Independency; and another, in Prelacy; and another in Baptiſm: but the Scriptures are not divided, they agree, and hold out one thing; but you divide them, becauſe you live not in that life that gave them forth, yet you boaſt of your learning, that you have the Hebrew and Greek, and know the Original: but you ſee <hi>Pilate</hi> and the Jews had the Hebrew, Greek and Latine, yet knew not the Original, for had they known it, they would not have cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the Lord of life and glory.</p>
            <p>Therefore know you, that you may be, and are ignorant, though you think your ſelves wiſe: Silly men and women may ſee more into the myſtery of Chriſt Jeſus, then you: for the Apoſtles, that the Scribes called illiterate, and <hi>Mary</hi> and <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanna</hi> (ſilly women, as you would be ready to call them, if they were here now) theſe know more of the Meſſiah, then all the learned Prieſts and Rabbies; for it is the Spirit that ſearcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God, you may know, and yet murther the juſt, and think you do God good ſervice.</p>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:168327:3"/>
            <p>This I warn you in love, for I cannot but think that there are ſome among you, that ponder on this day, and if you would hearken to the light of Jeſus Chriſt in your conſciences, it would lead you from your own wiſdom, learning, and ſelf-con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eitedneſs, into the ſimplicity of Jeſus Chriſt, which is a myſtery of Faith hid in a pure conſcience: for your own wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom muſt be denied, if ever you will come to witneſs the life and power of true wiſdom, which the fear of the Lord is the beginning of; for ſo did they of old.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Apollo</hi> were very learned and eloquent, ſaith the Scriptures, yet <hi>Paul</hi> counted all his learning dung for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of the knowledge of Chriſt, let his ſecond Chapter of his firſt Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> be a full witneſs of this: and <hi>Apollo</hi> was willing to be inſtructed of his hearers <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Priſcilla</hi> that were Tent-makers, &amp; the learned that ſtudied cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Arts burnt their Books that were of great price, when they came to the knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt: ſo you now, would you hearken to JESUS CHRIST, and obey his light in your conſciences, you would come down to humility and the fear of the Lord, to the true wiſdom and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that you would not need ſo many Authors, and Books, you would not need to rent your heads with ſtudying, but you would come to ſee your Teacher in you, which now is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved into a corner, you would come to live a preaching life, and witneſs that Faith you talk of, to purifie your hearts from envy, pride and malice, and to get the victory over the worlds glory and honour that is ſo highly eſteem'd by you; and coming to ſee your ſelves in the light of Jeſus Chriſt, you will not Lord it over Gods heritage, nor lift your ſelves up above your Brethren in pride and arrogancy, but be a ſervant to all in love.</p>
            <p>Therefore, come now to the light, ſin no longer againſt that in your conſcience; for Antichriſt muſt be deſtroyed by the brightneſs of his coming, and God is gathering his people out from idol-Shepherds into his own fold, to make them one flock and to give them one Sheperd, that they may ſerve him with one conſent, for he hath fulfilled this Scripture in thouſands this day whom he hath gathered out of Antichriſts Opinions to worſhip one God in one way, in Spirit and Truth, ſpeaking
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:168327:3"/>all the ſame things: if you ſpeak with ten thouſand of them, they all agree, having one King, one Law giver.</p>
            <p>Now fret not at this, you that live at <hi>Babylon</hi> in confuſion, in diviſions: for the little ſtone cut out of the Mountain without hands, ſhall break <hi>Babylons</hi> Idols.</p>
            <p>Now conſider Friends and people your conditions, for what good doth all your preaching and hearing do you? break your ſleep, rent your brains, and as it were, ſpeak out your lungs, and alas who is bettered by it! was there ever more pride, light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, vanity, and wantonneſs, manifeſted in your Aſſemblies, then now? you make it the place where you ſet forth your pride, and vanity to the utmoſt: was there ever the like injuſtice, vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, falſhood and deceit in any age? that ſcarce can a man tell what men mean by what they ſay any longer.</p>
            <p>Men ſay in effect, <hi>That God hath forſaken the earth by their wicked practiſes:</hi> the people cry out upon the Prieſts, and ſay, <hi>That their Opinions have made them ſo wicked;</hi> and the Prieſts cry out upon the people, and ſay, <hi>That the fault is theirs: So that the Lord beheld, and in ſtead of righteouſneſs, equity and judgement, there is a cry.</hi> So your whole Religion is but a noiſe, the life, power and ſubſtance is not in it.</p>
            <p>On apoſtate <hi>England,</hi> what ſhall the God of mercies do for thee? what ſhall he do unto thee? he hath tried thee with mercies, and with the ſword, and then with peace again, and yet thou repenteſt not; he hath given thee his witneſs, his juſt one to reprove thee, to convince thee of ſin in thy conſcience, but thou h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Come down thou therefore that haſt built among the ſtars by thy arts and learning; for it's thy pride and thy wiſdom, that hath perverted thee thou haſt gone in the way of <hi>Cain,</hi> in envy and malice, and ran greedily after the reward of <hi>Balaam,</hi>

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:168327:4"/>the Church may propheſie one by one, and that wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men were in the Church, as well as men, do thou judge; and the Scripture ſaith, that a woman may not propheſie with her head uncovered, leſt ſhe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour her head: now thou wouldſt know the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that Head, let the Scripture anſwer, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.3. <hi>The head of every man is Chriſt.</hi> Man in his beſt eſtate is altogether vanity, weakneſs, a lye. If therefore any ſpeak in the Church, whether man or woman, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing appear in it but the wiſdom of man, and Chriſt, who is the true head, be not uncovered, do not fully appear, Chriſt the head is then diſhonoured. Now the woman or weakneſs, that is man, which in his beſt eſtate or greateſt wiſdom is altogether vanity, that muſt be covered with the covering of the Spirit, a garment of righteouſneſs, that its nakedneſs may not appear, and diſhonour thereby come. Here mayſt thou ſee from the Scriptures, that the woman or weakneſs whether male or female, is forbidden to ſpeak in the Church; but its very plain, <hi>Paul,</hi> nor <hi>Apollo,</hi> nor the true Church of Chriſt, were not of that proud envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Spirit that thou art of, for they owned Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus in man or woman; for <hi>Paul</hi> bid <hi>Timothy</hi> to help thoſe women that laboured with him in the Goſpel, and <hi>Apollo</hi> hearkened to a woman, and was inſtructed by her, and Chriſt Jeſus appeared to the women fi ſt, and ſent them to preach the Reſurrection to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and <hi>Philip</hi> had four Virgins that did propheſie. Now thou doſt reſpect perſons I know, and art parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al in all things, and ſo judgeſt wickedly, but there is no reſpect of perſons with God. Indeed, you your ſelves are the women, that are forbidden to ſpeak in
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:168327:5"/>the Church, that are become women; for two of your Prieſts came to ſpeak with us; and when they could not bear ſound reproof and wholeſome Doctrine, that did concern them, they railed on us with filthy ſpeeches, as no other they can give to us, that deal plainly and ſingly with them, and ſo ran from us. So leaving you to the light in all your conſciences to judge of what we have writ, we remain Priſoners in <hi>Exeter.</hi> goal for the word of God.</p>
